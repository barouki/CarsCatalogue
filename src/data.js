        "In many ways a delightfully inspired attempt to inject a bit of machismo into the otherwise entirely effeminate Fiat 500, the Abarth fails to hit the mark quite as we’d all hoped, but is nonetheless a hugely entertaining and characterful hot hatch for comparatively little money. It’s even more compelling now, since Abarth cut the price for the standard car and added some good-looking trims further up the range. The is a proper facelift coming soon, but at least for now it’s still outclassed by cars such as the Ford Fiesta ST.",

        "The Ferrari LaFerrari - or just LaFerrari if you will - is the apogee of Ferrari’s current roadcar programme: a carbon, two-seat hypercar that melds a 6.3-litre Ferrari V12 with a KERS-esque battery pack and electric motor to give 950bhp and 663lb ft of torque. As you might expect, it looks like a spaceship, and drives like the best Ferrari ever made. Which in terms of useable horsepower, it is. Only 499 have been built, available only to serious Ferrari collectors, and they’re all sold out. A car so fantastic the company decided to make it definitive (it is literally called The Ferrari), neatly annexing the Italian company in a weird little semantic cul-de-sac when it comes to naming its next car…",

        "The Ford F-150 Raptor owns the road—and pretty much anywhere else you drive it—thanks to its big all-terrain tires, lane-filling stance, and widened F-150 body. The Raptor's long-travel suspension gives it both awesome off-road capability and impressive ride comfort. Its 450-hp twin-turbo V-6 and 10-speed automatic transmission can shoot it to 60 mph in as little as 5.1 seconds. While its massive dimensions make it a bear to maneuver in tight quarters, it also can roll over pesky parking curbs with ease. Compared with conventional full-size pickups, the Raptor is on a whole other level—mixing serious capability and pure, dumb fun like no other.",

        "Determined to squeeze every last drop of turnover out of every last niche imaginable, Mercedes-AMG was not content with its CLS and instead made another four-door coupe for a select few to buy. The difference, however, is that this one is claimed to share DNA with the AMG GT supercar. Funny, then, that it's actually based on an E-Class. Confusing money-making tactics aside, the GT 63 and GT 63 S four-door coupes are impressive machines, both powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 that sends power to all four wheels via a nine-speed MCT auto. In the base model, the figures are 577 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, but if that doesn't satisfy your lust for insanity, the S version has a stratospheric 630 hp and 664 lb-ft. With 0-60 mph times as low as 3.1 seconds, the GT 63 leaves the Porsche Panamera Turbo behind in terms of performance and absolutely destroys it in the looks department too - not that making a prettier car than the Panamera is a difficult thing to do.",
